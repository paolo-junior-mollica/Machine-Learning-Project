# machine-learning-project
Academic project for the Machine Learning course, a.y. 2023/2024, by Nunzio Canduci, Paolo Junior Mollica, Andrea Marino.

## Link to the repository
The GitHub repo for this project has much more material than the package provided for delivery. Here is the link: https://github.com/paolo-junior-mollica/machine-learning-project
The BASEPATH variable contained in some notebook, is the path of the repo of the project, needs to be changed to start the run on other systems.
## Comparisons notebook
During our experiments, we save the produced models in a .joblib file. The saved models are not included in the delivered package due to space constraint. 
In order to execute the cells in the comparisons notebook, these file must be included in the path ../trained_models/cup2023 
The models can be found in the GitHub repo (link below), at the same path specified above.
