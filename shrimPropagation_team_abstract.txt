The chosen ensemble consists of five Pipeline models, each pairing a RobustScaler with an SVR. Using Scikit-Learn, 20% of the ML-CUP23-TS dataset was reserved as an internal test set.
On the remaining data, a grid search was performed to identify the best hyperparameters, employing 5-fold cross-validation. 
Next, the best performing model was retrained on the training set, following a 5-fold split identical to that used in the grid search, but on increasing dataset sizes.
Five replications of this optimal model were trained, each on a different portion (fold) of the dataset, preserving the same splits as in the grid search. The error on the test set was calculated as the average of the predictions of all models in the ensemble.
Finally, the ensemble was again trained on the entire dataset, maintaining the same 5-fold splitting scheme and the same random seed, with each subcomponent of the model trained on a specific fraction of the dataset.
