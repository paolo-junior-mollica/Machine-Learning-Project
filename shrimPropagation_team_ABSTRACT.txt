The chosen model is an ensemble of 5 Pipeline(RobustScaler, SVR), where RobustScaler is a data scaler and Pipeline joins together data transformers and predictors.
The model is created with Scikit-Learn, through the following criteria. 20% of the whole ML-CUP23-TS data is held out as internal test set. On the remaining part of the data
the grid search is performed to get the best hyperparameters (the range is in the slide and the code), using a 5-fold CV performed by Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCV. The best 
model is retrained on the TR set in a 5-fold splitting schema on increasing sizes of the training data, to create the learning curve with mean and stdev. 5 copies of the best 
model are created, each trained on (the complement of) a portion (fold) of the previous split. TS error is assessed by taking the average prediction of the ensemble's members.
The ensemble is then re-trained on the whole dataset by using the same schema (5-fold splitting with same random seed, each sub-model is trained on part of the data).
